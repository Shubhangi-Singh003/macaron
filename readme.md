French macaroon is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food colouring. The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the Renaissance.
Macarons have been popular in France for well over a hundred years and have solidified themselves as a desirable treat for oneself as well as a gift; they are extremely popular as a dinner party gift.
