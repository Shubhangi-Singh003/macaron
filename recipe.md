Step One: Measure out your ingredients.

Step Two: Sift together the powdered sugar and almond flour three times to get out any clumps that would cause air bubbles or lumpy macarons.

Step Three: Whisk egg whites and roughly 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white and frothy
One of my most favorite features of our Cafe Appliances Range is the 15K power boil burner which heats up quickly and evenly so you can make a double boiler in moments. We make our macarons with a swiss meringue, which means you’ll cook the egg whites a little before using them in your macaron batter. This will create a super stable macaron base that is much more forgiving.

Step Four: Transfer the egg whites to a stand mixer and slowly add the remaining granulated sugar, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form and the mixture is glossy. If using food coloring add here as well! 
You’ll know it’s done when the mixture is not longer grainy when you rub it between your fingers.

Step Six: Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the bowl and gently fold the batter from the outside of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner.
Do this until the batter is a lava like consistency and you can make a figure 8 with the batter without it breaking.

Step Seven: Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fit with a ½ inch tip. Pipe the macarons out a few inches apart onto two cookies sheets lined with parchment paper.
Step Eight: Bake the macarons at 300°F for 13 to 15 minutes (depending on the size).

Step Nine: Allow the macarons to cool completely before transferring to a cooling rack.

Step Ten: While the macarons cool, make the filling. Combine all the filling ingredients together in a bowl and beat until fluffy and creamy.

Step Twelve: Devour!
